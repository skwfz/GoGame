# GoGame

This repository contains code for a small for-fun project, where I made a user interface for playing Go and also a very simple AI opponent (is really slow and doesn't actually work at the moment). Also, I implemented an algorithm for detecting some groups that are clearly alive, and it shows them during the game. 

It requires pygame. Looks like running playgame.py currently sets up a game where you take turns with the opponent (changing it so that human players play turns against each other requires commenting out a few lines marked in the code). The board size can be changed with the "gamesize" parameter in pygame.py.  The game doesn't have any ending conditions.
